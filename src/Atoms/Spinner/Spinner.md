# Spinner component

A spinner!

## Props

`size` - a multiple of the `unit`.

`color` - a function to grab a color value from the theme, like so: `t => t.color.warning`.

`id` - a _globally_ unique id for the spinner. Tip: make it something descriptive that's unique for the page,
e.g.: `"marketCardSpinner"`... or just `"asdasdsfdsgdfsrarerd"`, as long as it's unique.

`delay` - set to `false` to disable the default delay, or a number to set the delay specifically. The delay is there to
prevent loading the spinner for quicker operations, where a spinner would just worsen the perceived performance.

## Some examples

```javascript
<Spinner id="defaultSpinner"/>
<Spinner size={8} id="largerSpinner"/>
<Spinner size={8} id="largerSpinner" delay={false}/>
```
