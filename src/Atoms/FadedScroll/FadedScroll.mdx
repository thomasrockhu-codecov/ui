# FadedScroll

This component provides a faded look to the bottom of a vertically scrollable element.

## Usage

This component is only intended to give an effect on screen sizes larger than 'md'. We try to not have scrollbars in mobile.
You can provide a maxHeightDesktop to the component or let this component take all available space of parent and if the content exceeds that hight then show the scrollbar.

## Props

<Props of={FadedScroll} />
